# VS Code Installation

I use a VS Code extension called CodeSync to import and export all of the VS Code files to .vscode. This can be done with the following:-

Open command palette...

`Shift + Command + P`

Set CodeSync Sync Path

`CodeSync: Set external sync path`

Import All

`CodeSync: Import All`

Export All

`CodeSync: Export All`
