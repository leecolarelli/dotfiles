# User-Level Claude Code Notes

## Project Organization Preferences

### CLAUDE.md File Location
- **Always store project-level CLAUDE.md files in a `.claude` directory**
- Path pattern: `{project_root}/.claude/CLAUDE.md`
- This keeps Claude's project memory files organized and separate from main project files

## Examples
- CRM-API project: `/Users/leecolarelli/Projects/CRM-API/.claude/CLAUDE.md`
- Other projects should follow the same pattern: `{project}/.claude/CLAUDE.md`
